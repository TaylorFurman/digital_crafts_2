CSS Shapes
In CSS you can produce different shapes via various hacks. For example a triangle pointing up can be produced with the following code:

#triangle-up {
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  border-left: 50px solid transparent;
  border-right: 50px solid transparent;
  border-bottom: 100px solid red;
}
See what creative hacks you can do to get the following shapes without Googling the entire shape.

Square
Rectangle
Oval
Circle
Triangle pointing down
Triangle pointing left
Right triangle
Trapezoid
6 Point star
Square Diamond
Pacman

Special Pythagorean triplet
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a^2 + b^2 = c^2

For example: 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.

Find the product abc.
