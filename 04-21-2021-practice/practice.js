//Algorithm 2
//If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

//Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Algorithm 3
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, â€¦

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
